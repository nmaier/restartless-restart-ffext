amo.description=This very tiny add-on will add a "Restart menu item to the "File" menu, and a configurable hot key (default: ctrl/cmd + alt + r) to Firefox or Seamonkey, which will restart the program. It can be installed/uninstalled or enabled/disabled without requiring a restart; hence the name "Restartless" Restart.
amo.description.more=Restartless restart is similar to the QuickRestart add-on, except that it does work exclusively in Firefox 4 and later and/or Seamonkey 2.1 and later. Furthermore it is smaller, integrated with the new Firefox menu, but it doesn't have a toolbar button (yet).
